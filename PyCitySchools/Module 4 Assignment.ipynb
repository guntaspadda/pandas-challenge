    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of this analysis was to understand trends in school performance based on varying school budgets and school sizes. \n",
    "- Based on the analysis, schools with higher per-student budgets did not have a higher % overall passing compared to schools with lower per-student budgets. The top 5 schools with the highest % overall passing had an average per-student budget of 485, and were all charter schools. On the other hand, the bottom 5 schools with the lowest % overall passing had an average per-student budget of 647, and were all district schools. This indicates that the per-student budget is not a leading indicator for school performance; other important factors include effectiveness of budget allocation, student to teacher ratios, student and teacher educational backgrounds, curriculum differences, and more. \n",
    "- Another interesting finding was while the top-5 schools and bottom-5 schools did not differ much in the % of students who passed reading, there was a much larger gap in the % of students who passed math, which contributes to the overall difference in % of students passing overall. The top 5 schools had an average of 84% students who passed reading and an average of 94% of students who passed math, leading to an average 91% overall passing rate. The bottom 5 schools had an average of 81% of students who passed reading, but a much lower average of 66% of students who passed math, leading to an average 54% overall passing rate. In order to improve overall pass rate, the worst-performing schools should focus on improving the pass rate of math classes. \n",
